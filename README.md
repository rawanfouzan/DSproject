# Hospital Reservation System

## Project Overview:
This project is a group project developed as part of the CS214 Data Structures course at Qassim University. It focuses on building a Hospital Reservation System using C++ and a Linked List data structure for efficient management of patient records and appointment reservations. The system supports functionalities like patient registration, reservation scheduling, cancellation, and tracking daily income from reservations.

## Team Members:
- Rawan Alfouzan 
- Aljazi Aleqab 

## Files Included:
1. hospital_reservation_system.cpp: Main C++ code for the system. This file contains all the classes and functions for managing patient and reservation data.
2. Hospital_Reservation_System.pdf: Project report, including the design, data structure selection, and main functions of the system.
3. CS214_Project_Presentation.pptx: PowerPoint presentation for the project, summarizing the system's features and design choices.

## Features:
- Patient Registration: Registers a new patient by storing personal information such as name, gender, and age.
- Reservation Scheduling: Allows patients to schedule appointments, ensuring no conflicts in the department or time slots.
- Reservation Cancellation: Enables users to cancel appointments, freeing up time slots.
- Reservation Completion: Marks the appointment as completed once the patient attends.
- View Reservations: Displays a list of all current reservations with patient details and status.
- Delete Patient: Deletes a patient's record, along with associated reservations.
- Daily Income Calculation: Bonus feature that calculates the total income for the hospital from reservations made on a specific day.

## Data Structure Used:
- Linked List: The system uses a linked list to dynamically store and manage patient and reservation data. Linked lists are ideal for this project due to their ability to handle frequent insertions and deletions efficiently.

## How to Run:
1. Download all the project files.
2. Open the hospital_reservation_system.cpp file in a C++ IDE or compiler (e.g., GCC).
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the system, including patient registration, reservation scheduling, and cancellations.

## Requirements:
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic understanding of C++ and linked list operations.
